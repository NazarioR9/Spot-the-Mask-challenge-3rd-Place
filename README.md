## üóí<span style='color:green'> Description </span>


In a time of concerns about slowing the transmission of COVID-19, increased surveillance combined with AI solutions can improve monitoring and reduce the human effort needed to limit the spread of this disease.

Since the anouncement of a lockdown, generalized in many counntries over the world due to the spread of COVID-19, Zindi community has started a new type of challenges called <span style='color:red'>#ZINDIWEEKENDZ </span>. It is a set of competitions based on data science in order to permit to all the #zindians the development of AI based solutions in order to use their skills for giving their community some technical means and  viable solutions to their community in this biological war.
A challenge is taking place every weekend from April to May 2020.

This hackathon was about predicting whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask or not. It was hosted by [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/spot-the-mask-challenge/) and lasted for 3 days (from Thursday 17 April to Sunday 19).  

##  üò∑<span style='color:green'> The solution </span> üß†
Our solution is based on the architechture of the well known model <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_densenet/">Densnet</a> and uses the technique of transfer learning to get some learned features form others tasks and use them in this contest to help our custom model to make accurate predictions.

</div>

The main framework used to implement the model is <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">Pytorch</a>. Some of us also used [Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [keras](https://keras.io/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) when experimenting.

With this model and with all the others techniques applied, we have been able to get the following results:

<div align='center'>

|set        | loss (log_loss)      | accuracy  |

## üå¥<span style='color:green'> Repository structure (treeüòé)</span>
You must follow this structure when runing the notebook.

|----Data  
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      |--- images.zip  
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      |--- train_labels.csv  
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      |--- sample_sub_v2.csv \
| \
|----Mask Challenge Solution  
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       |--- Spot_the_mask_challenge.ipynb  
|\
|---- Readme.md  
|---- environment.yml\
|---- requirements.txt  


PS : [Download dataset here](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/spot-the-mask-challenge/data) 

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies before going deep.\
\
If you are facing any issues with installation with `pip` you can use the environment.yml file to create an anaconda environment and then use one of these command lines below to activate it (you need to have anaconda distribution and **pip version 9.0.1** installed first) : 

 ```
 # 1- create the anaconda env and install dependencies
 $ conda env create -f environment.yml
 
 # 2- activate the environment containing the dependencies (pytorch, torchvision, keras, opencv etc...)
$ source activate spot-mask-env 

# or

$ conda activate spot-mask-env

# 3- Verify that the new environment was installed correctly by running:
$ conda list

# (optional) 
$ jupyter-notebook
```
Then you will be able now to use `jupyter-notebook` or your favourite text editor to execute the code and get our final result.
\
You will need a suitable **NVIDIA GPU** and **CUDA Toolkit**(>=9.0) to perfectly run the notebook.
